# Quantum tomography and classical shadows

I realised this code for the mini-project I had to present for my exam in Quantum Computing at EPFL. I spent roughly 50 hours on it (including the preparation of my slides and presentation) and my computer ran for at least 40 hours to perform the measurements.
